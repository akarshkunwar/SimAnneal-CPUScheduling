# SimAnneal-CPUScheduling
A MATLAB simulation program for CPU scheduling to demonstrate simulated annealing optimization algorithm, created for an assignment for my AI course.
This project landed me a research internship with my AI professor.
To run, open in MATLAB, go to SACPUScheduler.m, and run, preferably with a discrete GPU.
Below are a few screenshots for reference.
